# Numpy-Pandas

NumPY is an open source module of Python which provides fast mathematical computation on arrays and matrices. 

- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
  NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
