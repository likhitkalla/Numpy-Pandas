# Numpy-Pandas

NumPY is an open source module of Python which provides fast mathematical computation on arrays and matrices. 

- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
  NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
  
- NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

- NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
